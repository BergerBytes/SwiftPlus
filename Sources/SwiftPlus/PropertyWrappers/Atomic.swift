/// Atomic is a property wrapper that provides thread-safety by using a lock to synchronize access to a wrapped value.
///
/// This code defines a property wrapper, Atomic, which provides thread-safety for a wrapped value.
/// In a concurrent or multithreaded environment, it is common for multiple threads to try to access and modify the same piece of data at the same time.
/// This can lead to race conditions and other synchronization issues, which can cause unpredictable behavior and bugs in your code.
///
/// The Atomic property wrapper uses a lock to synchronize access to the wrapped value, ensuring that only one thread can access the value at a time.
/// This prevents race conditions and other synchronization issues, making it safe to use the wrapped value in a concurrent environment.
///
/// In addition, the Atomic property wrapper implements the Sendable protocol, which means that it can be safely shared among different threads.
/// This allows you to use the Atomic property wrapper to synchronize access to shared data in a multithreaded environment.
